# Moms-Who-Code-Stapleton
<h2>Welcome Moms</h2>
 <p>Currently, we are working on a group project, building a Mom's Club Website.  If you'd like to join in the fun, first you need to set up your IDE.  Checkout the Git Wiki, and click on 'Tutorials', then 'Install Rails'.  There's a lot of other great resources on the wiki, but 'Install Rails' will walk you through installing many of the tools you'll need to help with the website.  Once you're all set up, see the tasks we're working on in the Project Requirements below.</p>
